	USB-C is a 24-pin fully reversible-plug USB connector system allowing transport of data and energy.[1]

The USB Type-C Specification 1.0 was published by the USB Implementers Forum (USB-IF) and was finalized in August 2014.[2] It was developed at roughly the same time as the USB 3.1 specification.

If a product implements USB Type-C, it does not necessarily support USB 3.1 or USB Power Delivery.[3][4]

The USB-C connectors connect to both hosts and devices, replacing various USB-B and USB-A connectors and cables with a standard meant to be future-proof.[5][6] The 24-pin double-sided connector is slightly larger than the micro-B connector, with a USB-C port measuring 8.4 millimetres (0.33 in) by 2.6 millimetres (0.10 in). The connector provides four power/ground pairs, two differential pairs for non-SuperSpeed data (though only one pair is populated in a USB-C cable), four pairs for SuperSpeed data bus (only two pairs are used in USB 3.1 mode), two "sideband use" pins, VCONN +5 V power for active cables, and a configuration pin used for cable orientation detection and dedicated biphase mark code (BMC) configuration data channel.[7][8][9]

Connecting an older device to a host with a USB-C receptacle requires a cable or adapter with a USB-A or USB-B plug or receptacle on one end and a USB-C plug on the other end. Cable length should be 1.0 m or less. Legacy adapters with a USB-C receptacle are "not defined or allowed" by the specification, due to their being able to create "many invalid and potentially unsafe" cable combinations.[10]</section>
